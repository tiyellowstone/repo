Memories (MTP, EEPROM, or OTP) are very sensitive to voltage noise, especially during programming (burning).
A clean, stable 3.3V is critical when writing to memory, Or
-Failed programming
-Data corruption
-Lower reliability over time

Internal LDOs almost always expect at least a small external capacitor (like 1μF to 10μF) to:
-Stabilize the output voltage
-Handle transient currents during memory writes
-Reduce noise and ripple

cannot remove the LDO_3V3 pin — because:
- It’s a test hook, critical to measuring internal timing.
- Without the pin, we have no external way to observe when LDO_3V3 goes high.
- delay measurement becomes impossible or unreliable.
- Without the pin,  VLDO_3V3(UVLO_R),  VLDO_3V3(UVLO_F), ILDO_3V3(ILIMIT), LDO_1V5 Output Regulation 
voltage becomes impossible to test
 
It’s a test input — critical for ADC functionality.
- can’t feed known voltages into the ADC
- lose ability to validate ADC codes
- quality issue
