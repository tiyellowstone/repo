DFT Goals for OTP/MTP Memory BIST

implement logic that can:
Read all 0’s
Write/Read diagonal
Write/Read checkerboard
Write/Read inverse checkerboard
Read all 1’s
Perform marginal read tests
Test Mode and Result Logger

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation Strategy for Each Pattern

1. Read All 0’s
Assume OTP unprogrammed = 0.
Just read all addresses and check that value == 0.

2. Write/Read Diagonal
For address (i,j), write 1 if i == j, else 0.
After write, read back and compare.

3. Write/Read Checkerboard
If (address % 2) == 0, write 1; else write 0.
Compare after read.

4. Write/Read Inverse Checkerboard
Same as checkerboard, but invert write pattern.

5. Read All 1’s
In OTP, simulate this only after programming. Read and expect 1.

6. Marginal Read
Adjusts slow/fast clock, low/high Vdd, or increased sense amp threshold.

7. Test Mode and Result Logger
tester communicates over I²C or SWD.
Registers are exposed to trigger BIST, get results, and optionally read failing address.
